Deployment
---

== Traditional Deployment ==
 
After running Rehash locally, deployment is possible with the included deploy file, which is set up to deploy from a github repo to a Passenger gem server. You must have access to the github repo, which probably means you forked the original Rehash repo to one on your own github account.

The first step is to copy from the sample to a deployment file you can customize.
 cp config/deployment.sample.yml config/deployment.yml
 
 More instructions coming soon.

== Heroku ==

Rehash can be deployed on Heroku. More details coming soon.
